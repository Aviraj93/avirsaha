# Hey there! 👋
I’m neck-deep in computer science and AI, where I get to wrestle with code and occasionally make my computer smarter than my Wi-Fi. Currently, I’m gearing up for competitive coding contests—trying to turn those “Why isn’t this working?” moments into “Aha!” victories. It’s a wild ride of debugging, caffeine, and the occasional celebratory dance when the code finally runs.

1. Tackling problems with **C/C++**—because who doesn’t love a good challenge?
2. Automating my life (and maybe yours) with **Python**.
3. Tweaking **Neovim** configs with **Lua** to make my coding space feel just right.
4. Bringing some life to the web with **JavaScript**—Um no comments!

### What’s Here:

- **Projects**: A mix of things I’ve built—from AI experiments to web tools.
- **Configs**: My setup files to make coding smoother (and more fun).
- **Contributions**: Some open-source love to keep the community going.
